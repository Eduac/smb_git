git can strongly benefit scholarly communication.
framework because it preserves the rich history of the entire scientific process.

Although services such as GitHub do not offer any gaurauntee of long-term archiving, it would be easy to deposit a zipped up git repo into a member repository of the CLOCKSS such as Dryad (when associated with a member journal) or with services such as figshare (where unpublished content are also welcome).
"content will be replicated through the CLOCKSS network."
