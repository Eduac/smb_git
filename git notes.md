# git: A tool to facilitate reproducibility and increase openness and transparency in science.


1. The hallmark of good science is that it is reproducible. One way to ensure reproducibility is to include all of the underlying data, and code used in the analysis alongside publications in the form of supplements or by depositing them in persistent repositories. While such efforts despite being rare are extremely valuable, they are still likely to lose valuable provenance such as key decisions made at any point from the data acquisition and analysis to manuscript development and final submission. 

2. git is an open source distributed version control system (DVCS) that was originally developed to manage versions of the linux kernel code. The system provides a powerful way to track a version an entire research effort from start to finish. Unlike previous iterations of version control systems, git is particularly powerful because it is distributed allowing users to work asynchronously, and each copy contains the complete history of changes. Although git, and web-based git hosting services such as GitHub, have been popular in the software development community, this power has only recently been leveraged by the academic community and in a limited way. 

3. Hosted git services allow several researchers to work asynchronously and synchronize their efforts through a central server. Users can work asynchronously and merge their copies as necessary. While most merges are handled automatically, conflicts need to be resolved manually by an author.

 development on a project, a user can commit changes up to that point with a human-friendly message. This allows anyone to return the project to that state or pursue a different direction along a different branch. Thus, key decisions that may serious affect the trajectory of a paper can be quickly retraced (to either improve upon, pursue a different direction, or troubleshoot errors).

A git managed research folder also allows members within the lab to reuse methods and easily determine why certain decisions were made during the course of the project.

Much like a lab notebook, a git history, tracks the evolution of a research efforts with waypoints and notes that allow both the original researcher (and anyone else down the line) to retrace steps, pursue a different direction, or build something new from any point forward.

Unlike track changes in Word documents, git can keep track of contributions from unlimited authors maintaining an audit trail.

It also allows for soliciting feedback.

4. In this review, I outline reasons why more scientists should incorporate a **git** based workflow into their research. I also provide several use-cases for why a git based project can  improve overall transparency and reproducibility lacking in most scientific endeavors.
