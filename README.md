# git manuscript  
Author(s): [Karthik Ram](mailto:karthik.ram@gmail.com)

At the invitation of Source Code in Medicine and Biology, I am writing a manuscript outlining reasons why scientists should incorporate git into their regular academic workflow. In addition, I also include some specific real world examples of how git, and a git hosting service such as github improve transparency, reproducibility, enhance collaborative efforts, and lower the barrier for the larger community to build upon a piece of work.

This manuscript is a work in progress but comments and feedback are welcome as I develop the manuscript.
