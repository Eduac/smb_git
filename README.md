I am writing a manuscript reviewing reasons why more scientists should incorporate **git** into their regular academic workflow. In addition, I also include some specific real world examples of how git and a git hosting services such as GitHub can improve transparency, reproducibility, enhance collaborative efforts, and lower barriers to data re-use and accelerate development of new science.

Although this manuscript is currently a work in progress, feedback,comments and suggestions are quite welcome. Use [issues](https://github.com/karthikram/smb_git/issues/new) or email.
